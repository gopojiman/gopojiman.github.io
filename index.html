    Hello, my name is Theophanis Fox (Theo for short), and I am currently working on a Master's
    of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. I previously graduated with
    a B.S. in Computer Science from UCSC with Highest Honors, Summa cum laude. My current main 
    areas of interest include networking, machine learning, and distributed systems.
    <br><br>
    I've completed a number of projects for courses and hack-a-thons which are listed below. 
    Additionally, I've spent the summers of 2020 and 2021 as a Software Development Engineer 
    Intern at Amazon Prime Video, working to build and maintain scalable software that ensures 
    timely delivery of content to the platform's hundreds of millions of users.
